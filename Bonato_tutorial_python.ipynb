    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cancer**, a complex disease driven by the relentless evolution of somatic cells, presents one of the most formidable challenges in modern medicine. This evolution, marked by the accumulation of genetic alterations and the selection of advantageous subclones within a tumor, fundamentally shapes the disease's progression and response to treatment. Understanding this intricate process is not merely a biological curiosity; it is a cornerstone of effective **drug development**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pre-clinical animal models**, serving as invaluable surrogates for human tumors, offer a crucial platform to dissect this evolutionary process and assess the therapeutic potential of novel compounds. By replicating key aspects of tumor growth, heterogeneity, and treatment response, these models enable researchers to identify promising drug targets, optimize dosing regimens, identify biomarkers, evaluate compound safety, and predict clinical outcomes. However, extracting meaningful insights from these studies requires **rigorous statistical analysis** to quantify tumor growth inhibition, assess drug synergy, and discern subtle differences between treatment groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter explores the critical intersection of animal models, tumor evolution, and statistical analysis in the quest for effective cancer therapies. We delve into the nuances of study design, endpoint selection, and data analysis techniques tailored for **tumor growth inhibition (TGI)** studies. Our aim is to equip researchers with the knowledge and tools necessary to navigate the complexities of pre-clinical data, ultimately accelerating the translation of promising compounds from the laboratory bench to the patient's bedside."

    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial aims to equip researchers with the essential tools for designing and analyzing preclinical animal studies focused on evaluating the efficacy of anticancer drugs. The primary objective is to guide readers in modeling tumor growth dynamics and quantifying tumor growth inhibition (TGI) effects induced by novel compounds compared to control treatments (e.g., placebo or standard therapies).\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, we will:\n",
    "- Understand the fundamental principles of study design for preclinical cancer research, including considerations for animal model selection, treatment allocation, and data collection strategies.\n",
    "- Gain proficiency in statistical methods for analyzing tumor growth data, both in terms of continuous measures (tumor volume, growth rate) and time-to-event outcomes (survival, tumor progression).\n",
    "- Interpret and draw conclusions from TGI analyses, assessing the statistical significance and clinical relevance of treatment effects.\n",
    "- Apply these techniques to real-world data using simulated examples and Python code snippets provided throughout the tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "While no prior experience with Python or R programming is required, a basic understanding of statistical principles (e.g., hypothesis testing, P-values) and familiarity with concepts like linear regression, survival analysis, and non-parametric methods will greatly enhance the learning experience. My [open-source Jupyter Book](https://sbwiecko.github.io/intuitive_biostatistics/README.html), providing a Python-based companion to the \"Intuitive Biostatistics\" book, might be a valuable resource for this work. We encourage to actively engage with this Jupyter Notebook, adapting them to own datasets to solidify the understanding!"

    "#### Versatile visualization with `seaborn`\n",
    "\n",
    "[`Seaborn`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html) is a powerful data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib. It offers a higher-level interface for creating informative and attractive **statistical graphics**, often with less code than Matplotlib. The code is much more concise and does not require a separate function to calculate summary statistics. It also handles the calculation of geometric means and [confidence intervals](https://sbwiecko.github.io/intuitive_biostatistics/12%20-%20Confidence%20Interval%20of%20a%20Mean.html) internally (using bootstrapping method).

    "#### Visualizing individual tumor growth trajectories\n",
    "\n",
    "While summary statistics like the geometric mean and confidence intervals provide valuable insights into the average tumor growth trends, visualizing individual tumor growth curves offers a deeper understanding of the underlying variability and heterogeneity within each group. It allows us to identify outliers, observe patterns of response to treatment, and assess the overall distribution of tumor growth trajectories.\n",
    "\n",
    "To facilitate this visualization, we'll create a function `plot_individual_curves` that automatically generates subplots, one for each group, displaying the individual growth curves of all animals within the group. This approach simplifies the plotting process, making it easier to explore the data and compare treatment effects across groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "By examining these individual curves alongside the summary statistics, we can gain a more comprehensive picture of the tumor growth dynamics in our preclinical study. This holistic view can be crucial in interpreting the results, identifying potential issues with experimental design or data collection, and making informed decisions about the next steps in the drug development process."

    "### Overview of animal models in TGI studies\n",
    "\n",
    "Preclinical TGI studies rely on various animal models, each with strengths and limitations that influence their suitability for different research questions. While no model perfectly replicates human tumors, careful model selection can improve research efficiency and reduce the risk of late-stage drug development failures.\n",
    "1. Xenografts from human cancer cell lines:\n",
    "    - Advantages: standardized, high-throughput screening, cost-effective.\n",
    "    - Limitations: may not fully recapitulate the complexity of human tumors due to in vitro selection.\n",
    "2. Patient-derived xenografts (PDX):\n",
    "    - Advantages: can evaluate efficacy in heterogeneous populations, personalized medicine potential, biomarker hypothesis testing.\n",
    "    - Limitations: costly, technically challenging, limited availability.\n",
    "3. Subcutaneous vs. orthotopic xenografts:\n",
    "    - Subcutaneous: easy to establish, monitor tumor growth with calipers.\n",
    "    - Orthotopic: more accurately mimics tumor microenvironment, allows for studying invasion and metastasis.\n",
    "    - Limitations (orthotopic): technically challenging, tumor measurement may require sacrifice or imaging.\n",
    "4. Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs):\n",
    "    - Advantages: recapitulate syngeneic tumor-host relationship, can study multiple endpoints (tumor growth, metastasis).\n",
    "    - Limitations: asynchronous tumor development, long development time, difficult to measure deeply located tumors.\n",
    "5. Organoid models:\n",
    "    - Advantages: preserve tumor heterogeneity and microenvironment, standardized, controlled setting.\n",
    "    - Limitations: still under development, utility in drug discovery needs further investigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of animal model depends on the specific research question, budget, and available resources. While cell line xenografts offer high throughput and standardization, PDX models provide valuable insights into personalized treatment responses.  Orthotopic models offer a more realistic tumor microenvironment, while GEMMs allow for studying tumor-host interactions and multiple endpoints. Organoids hold promise for future research, but their applications are still being explored."

    "### Endpoints in preclinical TGI studies\n",
    "\n",
    "Preclinical TGI studies assess how well a new therapy ($T$) inhibits tumor growth compared to a control group ($C$). Researchers have various options for choosing endpoints, which are the measures used to evaluate treatment effects.\n",
    "1. **Tumor growth inhibition (TGI)**: this is a quantitative measure of how much a therapy reduces tumor size compared to the control. It's often expressed as a _percentage_ ($\\text{TGI}\\%$), where 0% indicates no inhibition and 100% indicates complete inhibition, or when the tumor completely stops growing or disappears.\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\\text{TGI}_\\text{T|C} = 1 - \\frac{f(Y_T)}{f(Y_c)}$$\n",
    "\n",

Time-to-event (TTE) endpoints: these focus on the time it takes for a specific event to occur, such as tumor reaching a certain size, metastasis or animal death (although using death as an endpoint is discouraged for ethical reasons). TTE can be useful for seeing _long-term treatment impact_.\n",
    "4. Categorical endpoints: This is a more qualitative way of looking at results. Instead of exact numbers, you put responses into **categories** like \"complete response\" (CR), \"partial response\" (PR), etc. This is similar to how results are often discussed in human cancer trials. The function $f$ in TTE can be conceptualized as comparing **relative risk** estimates between groups."

    "1. Ex vivo weighing: this involves surgically removing the tumor and weighing it, offering precise volume measurements. However, it's limited to a single time point at the end of the study.\n",
    "2. In vivo caliper measurements: this non-invasive method is quick and suitable for easily accessible tumors (e.g., those implanted under the skin). It involves measuring tumor dimensions (length, width, and height) and calculating volume using geometric formulas. Tumor volume is often calculated assuming an ellipsoid shape ($Y = 1/6 \\pi \\times L \\times W \\times H$), where $L$ is the length, $W$ the width and $H$ the height, or a simplified approximation for equal height and width ($Y = 1/2 \\times L \\times W^2$).\n",
    "3. Imaging techniques (MRI, CT, Ultrasound): for deeply located tumors, imaging methods provide detailed internal views and precise measurements, even for complex shapes. However, these techniques can be costly and raise ethical concerns due to the need for anesthesia and potential stress on animals.\n",

    "\n",
    "Types of measurement errors:\n",
    "- Bias (systematic errors): these are consistent deviations from the true tumor size, often caused by factors such as instrument limitations, observer variability, or assumptions about tumor shape. Caliper-based measurements, while convenient and cost-effective, are particularly prone to bias due to factors like tissue interference and subjective interpretation.\n",
    "- Random errors: these are unpredictable fluctuations in measurements that affect the precision of the results. While _unavoidable_, their magnitude can be _reduced_ through experience, training, and standardized procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Impact of measurement errors:\n",
    "- Bias: if not addressed, bias can lead to **inaccurate** conclusions about the effectiveness of a treatment. For example, a biased measurement tool might consistently overestimate tumor size in one group, leading to an incorrect conclusion about treatment efficacy.\n",
    "- Precision: random errors reduce the **precision** of measurements, making it harder to detect statistically significant differences between treatment groups. This can result in inconclusive results or underpowered studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strategies for mitigating measurement errors:\n",
    "- Study design: **randomization, blinding, and stratification** can help minimize bias and ensure **balanced** groups.\n",
    "- Measurement techniques: choose the most appropriate technique based on the tumor type, location, and desired accuracy. Imaging techniques (MRI, CT, ultrasound) are generally more precise but can be costly and raise animal welfare concerns.\n",
    "- Standardization and training: consistent use of instruments, standardized protocols, proper quality control, and extensive training can reduce both bias and random error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional considerations:\n",
    "- Small tumor volumes: measurement _accuracy tends to decrease for small tumors_ due to equipment limitations and the challenges of measuring irregular or inflamed tissues.\n",

    "    The model assumes that each treatment group has a potentially different average effect on the tumor volume, and this effect is captured by the parameters $\\alpha_j$. The mathematical equation that describes the model is $\\stackrel{*}{y_{i}} = \\sum_{j=1}^J{\\alpha_j I_{ij} + \\epsilon_i}$, where $I_{ij} = 1$ indicates the treatment $j$ to which each animal $i$ was assigned to, otherwise $I_{ij} = 0$, i.e., the animal $i$ is not in group $j$ if $I_{ij} = 0$, and $\\epsilon_i$ is the residual error term for animal $i$, representing the variation in tumor volume that is not explained by the treatment group. The model assumes these errors are normally distributed with mean 0 and variance $\\sigma^2$, i.e., $\\epsilon_i \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)$.\n",

For an animal in the control group, $I_{i1} = 1, I_{i2} = 0$, the equation becomes $\\stackrel{*}{y_i} = \\alpha_1 + \\epsilon_i$.

    "#### Model-based estimation of the TGI\n",

    "Let's now incorporate the predicted/estimated average tumor volume in the treatment group ($j = T$) and in the control group ($j = 1$) based on the linear model, with $\\widehat{Y_T} = e^{\\widehat{\\alpha_1} + \\widehat{\\alpha_T}}$ and $\\widehat{Y_1} = e^{\\widehat{\\alpha_1}}$, where $\\widehat{\\alpha_1}$ is the estimated mean of the log-transformed tumor volumes in the control group (intercept of the linear model), and $\\widehat{\\alpha_T}$  is the estimated difference in mean log tumor volume between the treatment group (T) and the control group, i.e., it quantifies the treatment effect on the log scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model works with log-transformed tumor volumes. However, to calculate TGI, we need to go back to the original scale (the actual tumor volumes). To do this, we exponentiate the log-transformed values.\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed earlier, the TGI is defined as the percentage reduction in tumor volume in the treatment group compared to the control group. Mathematically, this is $\\text{TGI}_\\text{T|1} = 1 - \\frac{f(Y_T)}{f(Y_1)}$. In the model, we estimate the parameters $\\alpha_T$ and $\\alpha_1$ using ordinary least squares (OLS). We denote these estimates as $\\widehat{\\alpha_T}$ and $\\widehat{\\alpha_1}$. Substituting these estimates into the TGI formula, we get $\\widehat{\\text{TGI}_\\text{T|1}} = 1 - \\frac{e^{\\widehat{\\alpha_1} + \\widehat{\\alpha_T}}}{e^{\\widehat{\\alpha_1}}}$. Using the property that $e^{a+b} = e^a \\times e^b$, we can simplify:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\widehat{\\text{TGI}_\\text{T|1}} = 1 - e^{\\widehat{\\alpha_T}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "By using the model-based estimates ($\\widehat{\\alpha_1}$ and $\\widehat{\\alpha_T}$), you're taking into account all the data points from both groups and adjusting for other factors that might influence tumor growth (e.g., baseline differences between animals). This approach can provide more accurate and reliable TGI estimates than simply comparing the raw average tumor volumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note that this method assumes that the linear model is a good fit for the log-transformed tumor volume data._\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Practical example\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose our linear model estimates are $\\widehat{\\alpha_1} = 4.6$, i.e., the mean log tumor volume in the control group, and $\\widehat{\\alpha_T} = -0.5$, i.e., the treatment effect for group T indicating a reduction in tumor volume compared to control. Then the estimated TGI would be $\\widehat{\\text{TGI}_{T|1}} = 1 - \\exp(-0.5) \\approx 0.393$. This means that the treatment is estimated to reduce the average tumor volume by approximately 39.3% compared to the control group at the end of the study."

    "Similar to example 1, this call calculates the TGI of 'therapy_a' and 'therapy_b' at day 18. However, it doesn't adjust for the baseline tumor volumes. We might choose not to adjust for the baseline if we are confident that the initial tumor sizes were very similar between the groups or if we want to see the raw effect of the treatment without considering baseline differences. Here we can see that the TGI values are comparable in both cases, and that the P values don't change the conclusion, sugesting that baseline adjustment may not be necessary.\n",

    "Note that the difference in degrees of freedom between baseline-adjusted and unadjusted models is expected and statistically valid. It reflects the fact that we're estimating an additional parameter when adjusting for baseline, which consumes one degree of freedom from the data. Generally, a lower 'df_residual' leads to slightly wider confidence intervals and potentially less significant P-values, as the model has less flexibility to fit the data. While adjusting for a significant covariate can increase power, adjusting for a non-significant covariate can actually decrease power. This is because we're using up a degree of freedom without gaining much explanatory power in return.\n",

    "\n",
    "Imagine you have three treatment groups (A, B, and C) and want to compare them all. If you perform multiple pairwise t-tests (A vs. B, A vs. C, B vs. C), [you encounter several issues](https://sbwiecko.github.io/intuitive_biostatistics/15%20-%20P%20Values%20and%20Statistical%20Significance.html#the-challenge-of-multiple-comparisons):\n",
    "1. Inflated type I error rate: each individual t-test has a chance of making a type I error (false positive), typically set at 5%. When you conduct multiple tests, the overall probability of making at least one false positive increases substantially. This means you're more likely to conclude that a treatment difference exists when it actually doesn't.\n",
    "2. Inefficient variance estimation: each t-test only uses the data from the two groups being compared to estimate the variance. This ignores the information from the other groups, potentially leading to less accurate and less stable variance estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple linear model (or ANOVA in this case) with pairwise contrasts addresses these problems:\n",
    "1. Controls for type I error: by performing a single overall test (e.g., F-test in ANOVA), you control the family-wise error rate, which is the probability of making at least one type I error across all comparisons. This ensures a more stringent threshold for declaring statistical significance.\n",
    "2. [Pooled variance](https://sbwiecko.github.io/intuitive_biostatistics/20%20-%20Statistical%20Power%20and%20Sample%20Size.html#the-effect-size) estimation: the linear model estimates the variance $\\sigma^2$ by pooling information from all the groups. This leads to a more reliable and efficient estimate, especially when sample sizes are small.\n",
    "3. Pairwise comparisons with adjustment: after the overall test indicates a significant difference, you can perform pairwise comparisons using contrasts. These contrasts can be adjusted for multiple comparisons (e.g., using Tukey's HSD), further controlling the type I error rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's illustrate how to use the Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons implement in the `tgi_single_time` function. This adjustment will ensure that we control the family-wise error rate when comparing multiple treatment groups to the control."

    "\n",
    "In a typical linear regression model (with an intercept), the **intercept** represents the average predicted value of the outcome variable when all predictor variables are zero. It serves as a baseline reference point. For example, in the model `log_tv ~ group`, the intercept represents the average log tumor volume for the reference group (typically the control group). The coefficients for each treatment group then indicate how much their average log tumor volume _differs_ from the control group's average.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you add `- 1` to the formula `log_tv ~ group - 1`, we're explicitly telling the model not to include an intercept term. This has two key effects:\n",
    "1. Change in interpretation: the coefficients now represent the _absolute_ average log tumor volumes for each group, not the differences from a reference group. There's no longer a baseline value that the treatment effects are compared to.\n",
    "2. Change in calculation: the model no longer tries to find a single intercept that best fits all groups. Instead, it estimates separate intercepts for each group, essentially allowing each group's average log tumor volume to vary independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine we have two groups with the following log tumor volumes:\n",
    "- Control: [4.5, 4.6, 4.7]\n",
    "- Treatment: [4.2, 4.3, 4.4]\n",
    "\n",
    "The intercept $\\alpha$ (which is different from the $\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\dots, \\alpha_J$ coefficients defining the TGI model) might be estimated as 4.6 (the average of the control group), and the coefficient for the treatment group $\\beta$ would be -0.3 (the average difference from the control group), using a model with intercept. With a model without intercept, the coefficients would be estimated directly as the mean of each group, i.e., 4.6 for the control group, and 4.3 for the treatment group.\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Pre-calculating individual TGI-delta and running OLS without adjustment\n",
    "\n",
    "In this approach, we would calculate the difference between the tumor volume at the time point of interest and the baseline tumor volume (and then log-transform these differences), for each animal, and then fit a simple linear model using only the TGI-delta values as the outcome and the 'group' as the predictor. In fact, creating a new column with adjusted values or ΔTGI is often preferred, as it can make the code more readable and easier to interpret. Instead of adding 'log_tv_baseline' to the model formula, we create a new column 'log_tv_adjusted' within the DataFrame itself. This column holds the log-transformed tumor volumes with the baseline values subtracted for each animal. The model formula is simplified to `log_tv_adjusted ~ group` when baseline adjustment is applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "With baseline adjustment, $\\text{log\\_tv} = \\alpha + \\beta_1 * \\text{log\\_tv\\_baseline} + \\beta_2 * \\text{group} + \\epsilon$, where $\\beta_1$ represents the association between the baseline log tumor volume and the final log tumor volume, $\\beta_2$ represents the average difference in log tumor volume between the treatment and control groups, after accounting for the baseline differences. The model will fit a _plane_ through the data points, estimating $\\alpha$, $\\beta_1$, and $\\beta_2$. In this case, $\\beta_2$ isolates the effect of the treatment, controlling for the baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, the model with 'log_tv_baseline' effectively adjusts for the baseline within the regression framework itself. By including 'log_tv_baseline' as a covariate, the model is implicitly calculating and adjusting for the differences in baseline tumor volumes. The individual TGI-delta values that we would calculate in the second approach are essentially derived from the _same underlying relationship_ that the first model captures. The TGI-delta is simply the difference between the log tumor volume at a specific time point and the baseline log tumor volume, which is exactly what the 'log_tv_baseline' term is accounting for.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second approach (pre-calculating TGI-delta) might be slightly easier to understand conceptually, as the adjustment is more explicit. However, the first approach (including 'log_tv_baseline' in the model) is often more statistically sound and offers more flexibility for modeling complex relationships. Moreover, the relationship between baseline tumor volume and the outcome is linear on the log scale, then both approaches should give similar results in terms of statistical power."

    "#### Going beyond simple comparisons: ANCOVA and non-parametric methods\n",
    "\n",
    "In real-world preclinical studies, tumor growth can be influenced by more than just the treatment itself. Factors like the initial tumor size, drug dosage, or even animal characteristics (sex, weight) can play a role. To account for these additional variables (**covariates**), we can extend our simple linear regression model to an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Purpose: adjusts the estimated treatment effects for the influence of covariates.\n",
    "- Model: the ANCOVA model includes both the treatment group and the relevant covariates as predictors:\n",
    "    $${y}_i^{\\ast }={\\sum}_{s=1}^S{\\beta}_s{x}_{is}+{\\sum}_{j=1}^J{\\alpha}_j{I}_{ij}+{\\epsilon}_i$$\n",
    "    where ${\\epsilon}_i\\sim N\\left(0,{\\sigma}^2\\right)$, ${x}_{si}$ represents the $i$ observations for the covariate variable ${\\boldsymbol{X}}_S$ (e.g., log-transformed tumor volumes measured at baseline, dose levels of a treatment, or animal sex) and ${\\beta}_s$ models the effects of the covariate on the final tumor volume.\n",
    "- Benefits: improves the accuracy of treatment effect estimates by reducing unexplained variability and increasing statistical power. We can then use the estimated parameters $\\hat{\\alpha_1}$ (the intercept) and $\\hat{\\alpha_T}$ (the treatment effect) in the original TGI-delta formula, now using the adjusted treatment effect from the ANCOVA model. We obtain a more accurate and statistically sound estimate of the TGI-delta, helping us isolate the true effect of the treatment on tumor growth while accounting for any initial differences in tumor size among the experimental groups.\n",
    "- Example: if baseline tumor volume is a covariate, ANCOVA can more accurately estimate how much the treatment affects tumor growth beyond the initial size differences.\n",
    "- Implementation: in Python, you can add covariates to the `statsmodels` model formula, as we did in the previous examples using 'log_tv_baseline'.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Handling unequal variances\n",
    "\n",
    "In the standard linear regression model (and ANOVA), we assume that the variance of the errors (the spread of the data around the fitted line) is constant across all groups. This is known as homoscedasticity. However, in some TGI studies, the variability of tumor volumes might differ between treatment groups. This is called **heteroscedasticity**. Ignoring heteroscedasticity can lead to inaccurate estimates of standard errors, confidence intervals, and P-values, potentially leading to incorrect conclusions about treatment effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this issue, we can relax the assumption of equal variances by allowing each group to have its own variance: ${\\epsilon}_i\\sim N\\left(0,\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma} \\right)$. The matrix representation of the residual error variance $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}$ provides a way to do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma } =\\left(\\begin{array}{ccc}{\\sigma}_1^2& 0& 0\\\\ {}0& \\ddots & 0\\\\ {}0& 0& {\\sigma}_J^2\\end{array}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this matrix, the diagonal elements ($\\sigma_1^2, \\sigma_2^2, \\dots, \\sigma_J^2$) represent the variances of the residual errors within each of the $J$ treatment groups, and the off-diagonal elements are all zero, indicating that the errors between different groups are assumed to be uncorrelated.\n",
    "\n",
    "This matrix form allows each group to have its own unique variance, capturing the potential heteroscedasticity in the data. It is used in a technique called [weighted least squares (WLS) regression](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/generated/statsmodels.formula.api.wls.html#statsmodels.formula.api.wls). In WLS, each observation is weighted by the inverse of its estimated variance. This gives more weight to observations with lower variance (more precise measurements) and less weight to observations with higher variance (less precise measurements). By properly accounting for the unequal variances, WLS regression can provide more accurate estimates of the treatment effects and their standard errors, leading to more reliable statistical inferences."

The statistical analysis approach depends on whether the time-dependent nature of the data is considered important or not.\n",

    "- Time-independent analysis: if the focus is solely on comparing treatment groups at each individual time point (not the _overall growth trend_), we can analyze each time point separately using the same methods as in single time-point studies (e.g., linear models, t-tests, ANOVA). This approach ignores the potential dependency between measurements taken on the same animal over time.\n",
    "- Time-dependent analysis: if we want to understand the overall patterns of tumor growth over time and how treatments affect those patterns, we'll need to use more advanced statistical techniques that explicitly model the time component.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the **variability** in tumor growth within each group is very large, it might be difficult to model the time-dependent trends accurately. In such cases, analyzing each time point separately might be a simpler and more practical approach. If we're primarily interested in comparing treatment effects at specific key time points (e.g., end of study, midway through), we might not need to model the entire growth curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "When baseline tumor volume is included as a covariate in the analysis (ANCOVA), the focus shifts to comparing the tumor growth trajectories from the second time point onwards, with $t = 2, \\dots, D$ where $2$ is the second time-point of data collection.\n",

    "The P-values obtained after Bonferroni correction are generally higher compared to Dunnett's correction. When using Bonferroni, we'll typically find fewer statistically significant results compared to using Dunnett's test. This is because Bonferroni is more stringent and requires stronger evidence to reject the null hypothesis. If we are specifically interested in comparing multiple treatment groups to a single control, and we are confident that the variances are roughly equal across groups, then Dunnett's test is often a better choice as it provides more statistical power while still controlling the family-wise error rate (FWER).\n",

The function calculates TGI (adjusted for baseline) at multiple time points (days 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18). This allows us to track how the difference in efficacy between both treatments evolves over the course of the study."

    "The inclusion of `baseline_adjusted=True` (with `baseline=0`) indicates that the analysis will account for potential differences in the initial tumor volumes between the two groups at day 0. This is crucial when comparing two active treatments, as baseline differences could confound the results. By setting `p_tails=2`, we are conducting two-sided hypothesis tests at each time point. This means we're looking for evidence that 'therapy_a' is either significantly better or significantly worse than 'therapy_b'. This is different from the usual one-sided tests used when comparing a treatment to a control, where the focus is on whether the treatment is better. In this specific example, we're not applying any correction for multiple comparisons (e.g., Bonferroni or Dunnett's). This is because we are primarily interested in the time course of the comparison between the two treatments, not just the individual P-values at each time point. However, we might consider adding a correction if we want to make more definitive conclusions about the overall significance of the differences across all time points."

Instead, we are treating each time point as an independent observation, leading to separate analyses for each time point.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach has some important implications:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inflated degrees of freedom: the calculated degrees of freedom might be overestimated because the repeated measures within animals are not accounted for. This could lead to overly optimistic P-values and potentially false-positive findings.\n",
    "- Reduced power: by not considering the correlation structure, we may be missing out on potential gains in statistical power that could come from utilizing the information contained in the repeated measures.\n",
    "- Limited inferences: the results of this analysis are specific to each individual time point and might not provide a comprehensive picture of the overall treatment effect over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these issues, we have a few options:\n",
    "1. Repeated measures ANOVA: this is a more appropriate statistical method for analyzing longitudinal data, as it explicitly models the correlation structure of repeated measures. However, it requires certain assumptions about the correlation structure and might not be suitable for all types of data.\n",
    "2. Mixed effects models: these models offer greater flexibility in modeling complex correlation structures and are often a good choice for analyzing longitudinal data. They allow us to account for both fixed effects (treatment groups) and random effects (individual animal variations).\n",
    "3. Generalized estimating equations (GEE): GEE models provide a robust way to analyze longitudinal data when the correlation structure is complex or unknown. They can be more flexible than repeated measures ANOVA and are less sensitive to missing data."

    "#### Analyzing longitudinal TGI data\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Modeling tumor growth curves\n",
    "\n",
    "When researchers are interested in understanding the dynamics of tumor growth over time, longitudinal TGI studies provide a valuable framework. By summarizing tumor growth curves into a few key parameters, such as growth rate or area under the curve, we can make meaningful comparisons between treatment groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the variability between individual tumors within a group isn't too large, we can use longitudinal models to analyze the data. This approach is generally more efficient than looking at single time points because it takes into account the entire growth pattern over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "For short-term TGI studies (common due to animal welfare considerations), the **exponential model** is often used to fit the growth curves. This model assumes that tumors grow exponentially, translating to a linear relationship between log-transformed tumor volumes and time. [**Mixed-effects models (MEMs)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_model) are a powerful statistical framework for analyzing longitudinal data. In the context of TGI studies, they allow us to estimate the average growth curve for each treatment group while accounting for individual variations in tumor growth between animals:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fixed effects: represent the average intercept and slope (growth rate) for each _treatment group_.\n",
    "- Random effects: represent the individual deviations in intercept and slope for each animal within a treatment group.\n",
    "- Error structure: models both between-animal (variations between animals in the same group) and within-animal (variations in measurements for the same animal) sources of variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "By accounting for within-animal variability (correlations between measurements from the same animal), mixed-effects, i.e., fixed + random, models are more efficient than fixed-effects models, which ignore this correlation. Furthermore, the model's inferences can be extended to the broader population of animals, not just the specific sample in the study."

    "##### The mathematics behing MEMs\n",
    "\n",
    "The mixed effects model for exponential growth is represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$${y}_{it}^{\\ast }={\\sum}_{j=1}^J\\left[\\left({\\alpha}_j+{\\omega}_{ij}\\right)+\\left({\\beta}_j+{\\varphi}_{ij}\\right){t}_{ij}\\right]{I}_{ij}+{\\Sigma}_{it}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\stackrel{*}{y_{it}}$: log-transformed tumor volume for animal $i$ at time $t$.\n",
    "- $t_{ij}$: time of measurement for animal $i$ in group $j$.\n",
    "- $\\alpha_j$: intercept (initial tumor volume) for treatment group $j$.\n",
    "- $\\omega_{ij}$: random intercept deviation for animal $i$ in group $j$.\n",
    "- $\\beta_j$: slope (growth rate) for treatment group $j$.\n",
    "- $\\varphi_{ij}$: random slope deviation for animal $i$ in group $j$.\n",
    "- $I_{ij}$: indicator variable ($1$ if animal $i$ is in group $j$, $0$ otherwise).\n",
    "- ${\\Sigma}_{it}$: residual error term.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Random effects: capturing individual animal variations\n",
    "\n",
    "The random intercept ($\\omega$) represents the _baseline differences_ in tumor volume _between_ individual animals within the same treatment group. Some animals might naturally have larger or smaller tumors at the start, regardless of the treatment. The random slope ($\\varphi$) represents the _individual differences_ in tumor growth rates _within_ the same treatment group. Some animals might naturally have faster or slower growing tumors than others in their group.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **variance-covariance** matrix $\\boldsymbol{G}$ describes the relationships between these random effects $\\boldsymbol{G}=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}{\\sigma}_{\\omega}^2& {\\sigma}_{\\omega \\varphi}^2\\\\ {}{\\sigma}_{\\omega \\varphi}^2& {\\sigma}_{\\varphi}^2\\end{array}\\right]$, where ${\\sigma}_{\\omega}^2$ is the variance of the random intercepts (between-animal variability in initial tumor volume), ${\\sigma}_{\\varphi}^2$ is the variance of the random slopes (between-animal variability in growth rate), and ${\\sigma}_{\\omega \\varphi}^2$ is the covariance between random intercepts and slopes. This captures whether animals with larger initial tumors tend to have faster or slower growth rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Between-animal vs. within-animal variation\n",
    "\n",
    "The **between-animal variation** is the variation in tumor growth between different animals within the same treatment group. It's captured by the random effects and their variance-covariance matrix ($\\boldsymbol{G}$). The **within-animal variation** is the variation in tumor growth within the same animal over time. It's captured by the residual error term (${\\Sigma}_{it}$). In the context of the mixed effects model for tumor growth, the residual error term captures the variability in tumor volume that is not explained by the fixed effects (treatment group effects) or the random effects (individual animal deviations). Specifically, ${\\Sigma}_{it}$ might be modeled as a combination of:\n",
    "1. Measurement error: the inherent variability in measuring tumor volume, which could be due to the limitations of the measurement technique or biological factors.\n",
    "2. Within-animal variability: the natural fluctuations in tumor growth over time within an individual animal that are not captured by the overall growth trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Advantages of MEMs\n",
    "\n",
    "Mixed effects models are particularly well-suited for analyzing longitudinal TGI data because they:\n",
    "\n",

    "##### Estimating TGR with MEMs with Python\n",

    "###### Statistical distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "R's `nlme::lme` function uses t-tests to assess the significance of the fixed effects, particularly when the sample size is relatively small or when the degrees of freedom for the denominator of the test statistic are not well-defined. The t-distribution is appropriate in these cases because it accounts for the uncertainty in estimating the standard error of the fixed effects. R often defaults to reporting t-values in model summaries, even if the sample size is large enough that a z-test would be appropriate. This is likely due to historical reasons and the common practice of using t-tests for small samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statsmodels' `mixedlm`, on the other hand, [tends to use z-tests](https://github.com/statsmodels/statsmodels/issues/2620) (based on the standard normal distribution) to assess the significance of the fixed effects. This is often a _reasonable approximation_ when the sample size is large, and the degrees of freedom for the denominator are well-estimated. Statsmodels generally favors reporting z-values in model summaries, as it assumes that you are often working with larger sample sizes where the z-test is a suitable approximation.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the test statistics (t-values vs. z-values) might differ slightly, the interpretation of the results remains similar. The P-values associated with these test statistics can be used to assess the statistical significance of the fixed effects in both cases. If the sample size is small, the t-distribution might be a more appropriate choice. We could consider [calculating the degrees of freedom]() and use t-distribution table (or Python's scipy.stats module) to obtain more accurate p-values. If the sample size is large, [the difference between t-values and z-values will be negligible](https://sbwiecko.github.io/intuitive_biostatistics/12%20-%20Confidence%20Interval%20of%20a%20Mean.html#critical-z-vs-t-values). In most practical cases, the difference in results is negligible.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the mixed-effects model used for TGR analysis, the degrees of freedom are calculated based on the number of animals (groups) and the number of time points. Since we typically have multiple time points, this often results in a relatively high number of residual degrees of freedom. For example, in a study with one treatment group and one control group with 6 animals per group, and 6 time-points analyzed, the degrees of freedom exceed 30.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the number of animals and/or time points is very small, or in some complex mixed-effects models where the exact degrees of freedom might not be easily determined, using the t-distribution can be a more conservative approach in such cases."

    "###### The interaction effect\n",
    "\n",
    "In the model, the formula `log_tv ~ C(group, Treatment(reference='control')) * day` specifies a model with 'C(group, Treatment(reference='control'))' which represents the effect of each treatment group (excluding the reference group, \"Control\") on the log tumor volume, i.e., the **main effects**, and '* day' the interaction term which models how the effect of each treatment group changes over time, i.e., the **interaction effect**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main effect coefficient for 'C(group, Treatment(reference='control'))[T.therapy_xx]' only captures the _average difference_ in tumor growth rate between the \"therapy_xx\" group and the control group across all time points. However, the treatment effect might not be constant over time; it could increase or decrease as the study progresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a TGR analysis, we're interested in the _rate of change of tumor volume over time_, not just the overall difference at a specific time point. The interaction term `group:day` captures this rate of change (**slope**) for each treatment group relative to the control group. Therefore, by extracting the coefficient from 'C(group, Treatment(reference='control'))[T.therapy_xx]:day', we're getting the _estimated difference in the tumor growth rate_ between the \"therapy_xx\" group and the \"control\" group, i.e., the TGR value. Let's say the coefficient for the interaction term is -0.05. This means that, on average, for each additional day in the study, the \"therapy_xx\" group's log tumor volume is estimated to be 0.05 units lower than what would be expected based on the control group's growth rate and the overall treatment effect of \"therapy_xx.\", in other words, the therapy's effectiveness in reducing tumor growth increases over time compared to the control group."

    "The exponential growth model assumes that the logarithm of tumor volume increases linearly with time. However, in reality, early tumor growth often doesn't perfectly follow this pattern. There can be a **lag phase** or initial slow growth before the exponential phase kicks in. Including these early time points in the model can:\n",
    "-Bias the slope estimate: the early, slower growth can pull down the estimated slope of the regression line, making it appear flatter than it actually is during the truly exponential phase. This can underestimate the treatment effect (difference in slopes between groups).\n",

    "By selecting time points where the log tumor volume appears to be linear (e.g., 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 days in our example), we're focusing the analysis on the period where the exponential growth assumption is more likely to be valid.

    "##### Modeling tumor growth with quadratic exponential models\n",
    "\n",
    "In preclinical TGI studies that run for a moderate duration, a phenomenon known as **tumor growth deceleration** might occur towards the end of the experiment. This means that the tumor growth rate slows down, rather than remaining constant as assumed in the exponential growth model. This deceleration can be attributed to various factors:\n",
    "- Resource limitations: as tumors grow larger, they might outstrip the available resources in their surrounding environment, such as nutrients and oxygen, leading to slower growth.\n",
    "- Spatial constraints: the physical space within the animal or the tumor implantation site might limit the tumor's ability to expand further.\n",
    "- Treatment effects: some treatments might not only inhibit tumor growth but also actively induce tumor regression or cell death, causing a decline in the growth rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "To account for this deceleration, a more flexible model is needed. The quadratic exponential model is a suitable alternative as it incorporates a term that captures the change in growth rate over time. The model is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E\\left({Y}_{it}^{\\ast}\\right)={\\sum}_{j=1}^K\\left[{\\alpha}_j+{\\beta}_j{t}_{ij}+{\\gamma}_j{t}_{ij}^2\\right]{I}_{ij}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- ${Y}_{it}^{\\ast}$: log-transformed tumor volume for animal $i$ at time $t$.\n",
    "- ${\\alpha}_j$: intercept (initial tumor volume) for treatment group $j$.\n",
    "- ${\\beta}_j$: initial growth rate for treatment group $j$.\n",
    "- ${\\gamma}_j$: tumor decay rate (TDR) for treatment group $j$, capturing the deceleration effect over time.\n",
    "- ${t}_{ij}$: time of measurement for animal $i$ in group $j$.\n",
    "- ${I}_{ij}$: indicator variable ($1$ if animal $i$ is in group $j$, $0$ otherwise).\n",
    "\n",
    "The quadratic term (${t}_{ij}^2$) allows for modeling a change in growth rate over time. A positive ${\\gamma}_j$ implies a decreasing growth rate (deceleration), while a negative ${\\gamma}_j$ would indicate an increasing growth rate (acceleration). The longer the experiment, the more pronounced the effect of the quadratic term becomes. This is because the square of the time (${t}_{ij}^2$) becomes larger, leading to a faster deceleration (or acceleration) of tumor growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model can better represent the complex dynamics of tumor growth, where the rate might not be constant throughout the study. And by capturing the deceleration of growth, the model can lead to more accurate estimates of treatment effects compared to a simple exponential model. However, the model is more complex than the simple exponential model, requiring additional parameters (${\\gamma}_j$) to be estimated, and the interpretation of the coefficients might be less intuitive, as the growth rate is no longer constant but depends on time.\n",
    "\n",
    "To simulate the complex, non-linear growth patterns observed in some tumors, the function below creates virtual groups of animals whose tumor volumes evolve according to the quadratic exponential model, a more nuanced approach than simple exponential growth."

    "   - R (lme): the `lme` function in the `nlme` package typically uses Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) as the default estimation method for mixed-effects models. REML aims to provide unbiased estimates of the variance components (the random effects).\n",
    "   - Python (statsmodels): The `mixedlm` function in `statsmodels` also uses REML as a default method. However, there might be subtle differences in the specific algorithms and optimizations used in each library, leading to slightly different estimates.\n",
    "2. Differences in default settings:\n",
    "   - Convergence criteria: the convergence criteria for the iterative optimization algorithms used to fit the models might differ between the two libraries. This could lead to slightly different stopping points and therefore different estimates.\n",
    "   - Parameterization of random effects: the way the random effects are parameterized and the default assumptions about their distribution (e.g., unstructured vs. diagonal covariance matrix) might also vary slightly, contributing to the differences.\n",
    "3. Numerical precision:\n",
    "   - The underlying numerical libraries and calculations used by R and Python might have slight differences in precision, which can accumulate and lead to small variations in the final estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpreting the results:\n",
    "- Intercept: the intercept represents the baseline log-transformed tumor volume for the reference group at day 0. The difference between the R and Python estimates (e.g., 5.622 vs. 4.493) suggests a slight shift in the baseline level between the two models.\n",
    "- TGR: the TGR represents the average change in log tumor volume per day for each group. The discrepancy between R (3.8543) and Python (-0.042) is more substantial. This might indicate a difference in how the models are estimating the time-dependent effect of the treatment.\n",
    "- TDR: the TDR represents the acceleration or deceleration in the growth rate over time. Again, the difference between R (2.81) and Python (0.003) suggests some variation in how the quadratic term is being estimated by the two models.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the exact numerical values might differ, the overall conclusions about the relative effects of the treatments should be consistent between the two implementations.\n",
    "The statistical significance of the treatment effects (as indicated by p-values) should also be similar, although minor differences are possible due to the variations in degrees of freedom and estimation methods.\n",

    "##### Modeling long-term tumor dynamics with the Gompertzian model\n",
    "\n",
    "While exponential and quadratic exponential models are useful for capturing tumor growth patterns over shorter periods, they have a key limitation: they predict unlimited growth. However, long-term experiments reveal that tumor growth doesn't continue indefinitely. It eventually plateaus due to factors like limited resources and space constraints within the body.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Gompertzian model addresses this limitation](https://www.tmlep.com/clinical-learning/2023-01-23-when-did-this-tumour-start-the-need-for-a-gompertzian-understanding-of-tumour-growth-kinetics) by introducing a **theoretical upper limit** ($y_\\text{max}$) to tumor volume. This means that the model predicts tumor growth will slow down and eventually stop as it approaches this maximum size, more accurately reflecting real-world observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gompertzian model is applied to a transformed version of the tumor volume data, i.e., ${y}_{it}^{\\dagger }=\\ln \\left(\\ln \\left({y}_{max}/{y}_{it}\\right)\\right)$. This _double log-transformation_ linearizes the relationship between tumor growth and time. The model can then be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E\\left({Y}_{it}^{\\dagger}\\right)={\\eta}_j+{t_{ij}}^{\\ast }{\\lambda}_j$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $E\\left({Y}_{it}^{\\dagger}\\right)$: expected value of the double log-transformed tumor volume for animal $i$ at time $t$.\n",
    "- ${\\eta}_j$: a parameter related to the initial tumor volume and growth rate for treatment group $j$.\n",
    "- ${\\lambda}_j$: the **Gompertzian force** for treatment group $j$, which determines the rate at which tumor growth slows down.\n",
    "- ${t_{ij}}^{\\ast }$: time of measurement for animal $i$ in group $j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ${\\eta}_j$ parameter combines information about the initial tumor volume ($\\alpha_j$) and the initial growth rate ($\\beta_j$) for group $j$, i.e., ${\\eta}_j=\\ln \\left({\\beta}_j/{\\alpha}_j\\right)$. A higher ${\\eta}_j$ indicates a larger initial tumor or faster initial growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "${\\lambda}_j$ is the key parameter in the Gompertzian model. It represents the \"force of mortality\" or the rate at which the tumor's growth potential decreases over time. A larger positive value of ${\\lambda}_j$ means the tumor growth slows down more quickly, and when ${\\lambda}_j$ approaches zero, the Gompertzian model reduces to the exponential growth model, indicating constant growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the growth rate at any given time can be calculated as ${\\beta_j}^{\\ast}\\mathit{\\exp}\\left({t_{ij}}^{\\ast }{\\lambda}_j\\right)$. This shows that the growth rate decreases exponentially over time due to the Gompertzian force.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gompertzian model requires knowledge of the maximum tumor volume ($y_\\text{max}$), which can only be estimated accurately by allowing tumors to grow for extended periods until they reach a plateau. This raises _ethical concerns_ about animal welfare, as it can lead to prolonged suffering."

    "The Gompertzian model provides a more realistic representation of tumor growth compared to the exponential or quadratic exponential models, especially for long-term studies. It incorporates the concept of a _carrying capacity_, which represents the maximum tumor volume achievable due to biological constraints. We'll simulate data following this model while using log-normal distribution for individual tumor volumes to introduce realistic variability. In contrast to shorter-term studies where animal welfare considerations might limit tumor size, the goal of this simulation is to explore the theoretical long-term dynamics of tumor growth under different treatment conditions. Therefore, we won't be implementing the concept of \"welfare missing,\" as we're interested in observing how tumor volumes evolve over an extended period, even if they exceed what would be ethically permissible in a real animal study."

    "##### Long-term TGI studies and the Gompertzian model\n",
    "\n",
    "As we discussed earlier, the Gompertzian model is well-suited for analyzing long-term tumor growth inhibition (TGI) studies where tumors might reach a plateau due to factors like limited resources or space. In this model, we transform the tumor volume data using the following equation ${y}_{ij k}^{\\dagger }=\\ln \\left(\\ln \\left({y}_{max}/{y}_{ij k}\\right)\\right)$, where ${y}_{max}$ is the maximum tumor volume (carrying capacity), and ${y}_{ij k}$ is the observed tumor volume for animal $i$ in group $j$ at time $k$. This transformation makes the relationship between the transformed tumor volume (${y}_{ij k}$) and time approximately linear, allowing us to use a linear mixed-effects model for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following formula defines a mixed-effects model to analyze tumor growth rates (TGRs) in a longitudinal TGI study, assuming that the tumor growth follows a Gompertzian pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E\\left({y}_{ij k}^{\\dagger}\\right)=\\left({\\eta}_j+{n}_{ij}\\right)+\\left({\\lambda}_j+{l}_{ij}\\right)\\ast {t}_{ij k}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down each component of this equation:\n",
    "- $E\\left({y}_{ij k}^{\\dagger}\\right)$: this represents the _expected value (average)_ of the transformed tumor volume (${y}_{ij k}^{\\dagger}$) for animal $i$ in group $j$ at the $k$-th time point. The dagger ($^{\\dagger}$) symbol indicates the transformation of the original tumor volume ($y$) using the Gompertzian formula.\n",
    "- ${\\eta}_j$: this is the fixed effect for the intercept of the $j$-th group. It represents the average initial transformed tumor volume for animals in group $j$ at the beginning of the study ($t=0$).\n",
    "- ${n}_{ij}$: this is the random effect for the intercept, capturing individual variations in the initial transformed tumor volume among animals within the same group. It's assumed to be normally distributed with a mean of 0.\n",

The interpretation also depends on whether this difference is statistically significant.

    "\n",
    "When analyzing longitudinal tumor growth data, one way to condense the information from multiple time points is to calculate the **Area Under the Curve (AUC)** for each animal's growth trajectory. The AUC represents the cumulative effect of tumor growth over time, providing a single value for each animal that can be used for statistical comparisons between groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why use log-transformed values (${y}_{ijt}^{\\ast }$)?\n",
    "1. _Balancing early and late time points_: in tumor growth curves, early time points often show rapid growth, while later time points may show slower growth or even a plateau. Using the raw tumor volumes (${y}_{ijt}^{\\ast }$) for AUC calculation can give undue weight to these early rapid growth phases. Log-transforming the values (${y}_{ijt}^{\\ast }$ = ln({y}_{ijt}))$ helps to balance the influence of early and late time points, ensuring a more even contribution across the study period.\n",
    "2. _Standardizing to zero_: subtracting the initial log-transformed tumor volume (${y}_{ij1}^{\\ast }$) from all subsequent values for the same animal standardizes the growth curves to start at zero. This focuses the AUC analysis on the change in tumor growth over time rather than absolute tumor volumes, which can vary between animals even within the same group.\n",
    "\n",
    "While various methods exist for calculating AUC, the **trapezoidal rule** is the most commonly used due to its simplicity and ease of implementation. It approximates the area under the curve by dividing it into trapezoids and summing their areas, with $\\text{AUC}_{t_1 - t_2} \\approx \\sum[1/2 * ({y}_{ijt_1}^{\\ast } + {y}_{ijt_2}^{\\ast }) * (t_2 - t_1)]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have calculated the AUC values for each animal, you can treat these values as your outcome variable and perform standard statistical tests like t-tests (for two groups) or ANOVA (for multiple groups) to compare the average AUC between treatment and control groups. This tells us if there's a statistically significant difference in the overall tumor growth pattern over time."

    "- Event definition: the event of interest can be defined in various ways, depending on the study goals and the biology of the tumor.\n",
    "- Censored observations: animals that don't experience the event by the end of the study, or are removed for other reasons, are considered **censored**. This means we know they didn't have the event up to a certain point, but we don't know when or if it would have happened later.\n",
    "- Assumption of independent censoring: TTE analysis typically assumes that censoring is independent of prognosis, meaning the reasons for censoring (e.g., end of study) are unrelated to whether or not the animal would have eventually experienced the event. This assumption is often reasonable in TGI studies.\n",
    "- Statistical methods:\n",
    "  - Kaplan-Meier curves: used to estimate the **survival** (or event-free) probability over time.\n",
    "  - Log-rank test: used to compare the survival curves of different treatment groups.\n",

    "#### The Cox Proportional Hazards (CPH) model and beyond\n",
    "\n",
    "When analyzing the time it takes for a specific event (e.g., tumor reaching a certain size) to occur in preclinical cancer studies, the Cox Proportional Hazards (CPH) model is often preferred over other methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Choose the CPH Model?\n",
    "- Semi-parametric flexibility: the CPH model doesn't require you to assume a specific distribution for the survival times. It's more flexible than parametric models (like Weibull or Accelerated Failure Time) that make stronger assumptions about the underlying data.\n",
    "- Hazard ratios: the model quantifies the difference in **risk** (hazard) of the event occurring between treatment groups using **hazard ratios (HR)**. An HR greater than 1 means the treatment group has a higher risk, while an HR less than 1 means a lower risk compared to the control.\n",
    "- Covariate adjustment: the CPH model allows to adjust for other factors (covariates) that might influence the time-to-event, providing a more nuanced analysis of the treatment effect.\n",
    "- Robustness: despite its assumption of proportional hazards (meaning the relative risk between groups remains constant over time), the CPH model is often quite robust to violations of this assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hazard function ($\\lambda(t)$) represents the instantaneous risk of the event occurring at time $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\lambda (t)={\\lambda}_0(t)\\ast \\mathit{\\exp}\\left({\\sum}_{j=1}^J{\\beta}_j{I}_{ij}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The CPH model expresses the hazard function for each animal as a function of:\n",
    "- Baseline hazard ($\\lambda_0(t)$): the underlying risk of the event at time $t$, common to all animals.\n",
    "- Treatment effects ($\\beta$): the coefficients that quantify the increase or decrease in risk associated with each treatment group compared to the control group.\n",
    "- Indicator variables ($I$): binary variables ($0$ or $1$) indicating which treatment group each animal belongs to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatives to the CPH Model:\n",
    "- Parametric models: these models (like Weibull or Accelerated Failure Time) make specific assumptions about the distribution of survival times. They can be more powerful than the CPH model if the assumptions are met, but less robust if the assumptions are violated.\n",
    "- **Log-rank test**: the log-rank test is a non-parametric hypothesis test that compares the survival distributions of two or more groups. It's designed to determine whether there are statistically significant differences in the time it takes for an event of interest to occur between these groups. It's simpler than the CPH model but doesn't allow for covariate adjustment or estimation of hazard ratios. The log-rank test is often used in TGI studies to compare the time it takes for tumors to reach a certain size (the \"event\") under different treatment conditions. It's a valuable tool for assessing the long-term efficacy of treatments and can complement analyses based on tumor growth rates or AUC, but it can also be less powerful than the CPH model. How it works:\n",
    "  1. Observed and expected events: at each time point where an event occurs, the log-rank test calculates:\n",
    "     - The observed number of events in each group.\n",
    "     - The expected number of events in each group, assuming the null hypothesis is true (no difference between groups).\n",
    "  2. Test statistic: the test statistic ($D$) is calculated as the sum of the squared differences between observed and expected events across all time points, weighted by the number of individuals at risk at each time point.\n",
    "  3. Distribution of test statistic: under the null hypothesis, the test statistic ($D$) approximately follows a **chi-squared** distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the number of groups minus one. And the standardized log-rank test statistics approximately follows a standard normal distribution ($D/\\sqrt{Var(D)}$) under the null hypothesis. This allows us to use the standard normal distribution to calculate P-values and assess the statistical significance of the observed difference between groups.\n",
    "  4. P-value: it is calculated based on the test statistic and its distribution under the null hypothesis. A small P-value (e.g., less than 0.05) indicates that the observed differences between groups are unlikely to have occurred by chance alone, providing evidence to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "- Fleming-Harrington tests: these are also non-parametric tests, but they can be adjusted to emphasize early or late differences in hazard rates between groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using Python for TTE analysis in TGI studies\n",
    "\n",
    "LTTE analysis can reveal differences in the time to tumor progression or the overall survival of animals in different treatment groups. The following function, `tte_analysis`, offers two methods for TTE analysis:\n",
    "1. Cox Proportional Hazards (CoxPH) regression: this semi-parametric model estimates hazard ratios, which quantify the relative risk of an event occurring in different groups over time.\n",
    "2. Log-rank test: this non-parametric test compares the survival curves of different groups to determine if there are statistically significant differences in survival times.\n",
    "\n",

    "Time-to-event analysis provides a powerful framework for assessing the efficacy of anticancer treatments by examining the time it takes for specific events to occur. In the context of TGI studies, this often involves analyzing the time until a tumor reaches a certain size or progresses to a more advanced stage.  The Kaplan-Meier estimator and the Cox Proportional Hazards model are essential tools in this analysis, offering both visual and quantitative assessments of treatment effects.\n",

The results should be interpreted with caution, considering the specific context of the study, the choice of statistical method, and the potential for deviations from the model's assumptions."
